The film follows two stories of gangsters rising to power: a young Don Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), and his son Michael (Al Pacino) decades later. Coppolaâ€™s parallel structure allows him to compare and contrast two American eras and consider the political and cultural changes of the 20th century.
